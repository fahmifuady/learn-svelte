	In Svelte, an application is composed from one or more components. A component is a reusable
	self-contained block of code that encapsulates HTML, CSS and JavaScript that belong together,
	written into a .svelte file. The App.svelte file, open in the code editor to the right, is a
	simple component.

<div>
	code:
	<br />
	&lt;script&gt; export let name = &#39;Fufu&#39;; &lt;/script&gt;
	<br />
	&lt;h1&gt;Hello &lbrace; name.toUpperCase() &rbrace;!&lt;/h1&gt;
</div>
